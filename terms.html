                    Trademarks"</b>) used and displayed on the Service are RoxStar's registered and 
                unregistered trademarks or service marks. Other product and service names located 
                on the Service may be trademarks or service marks owned by third parties (the 
                <b>"Third-Party Trademarks,</b>" and, collectively with RoxStar Trademarks, the 
                <b>"Trademarks"</b>). Except as otherwise permitted by law, you may not use the 
                Trademarks to disparage RoxStar or the applicable third-party, RoxStar's or a third
                party's products or services, or in any manner (using commercially reasonable 
                judgment) that may damage any goodwill in the Trademarks. You may not use any 
                Trademarks as part of a link to or from any Service without RoxStar's prior express 
                written consent. All goodwill generated from the use of any RoxStar Trademark will 
                inure solely to RoxStar's benefit. <br>
                (g) Restrictions. RoxStar hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in 
                this Section 4. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement or on the Service will be 
                construed as granting to you, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any additional 
                license rights in and to the Service or any RoxStar Content or Trademarks located or 
                displayed therein. 
                <h2>5. User Content </h2>(a) Definition. <b>"User Content"</b> means any content that Users upload, post or transmit 
                (collectively, <b>"Post"</b> to or through the Service including, without limitation, any text, 
                photographs, User Recordings in the form of audio or audio-visual video (including 
                User Tracks embodied therein), and any other works subject to protection under 
                applicable laws, including, but not limited to, patent, trademark, trade secret and 
                copyright laws, and excludes any and all RoxStar Content (including, without 
                limitation, any Library Tracks incorporated into User Recordings). <br>
                (b) Screening User Content. RoxStar offers Users the ability to submit User Content 
                to or transmit through the Service. RoxStar does not pre-screen any User Content, 
                but reserves the right, with or without notice, to remove, disallow, block or delete any 
                User Content in its sole discretion and at any time. In addition, we have the right - 
                but not the obligation - in our sole discretion and at any time, with or without notice, 
                to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate 
                this Agreement, applicable law or otherwise constitute Objectionable Content; or (ii) 
                in response to complaints from other Users or licensors of any RoxStar Content or 
                any governmental authorities, with or without notice and without any liability to you. 
                Without limiting the preceding sentences of this Section, RoxStar also has the right - 
                but not the obligation - to take remedial action in connection with any Objectionable 
                Content Posted on the Service as described more fully in Section 5(i) below. RoxStar 
                does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness, availability or quality of 
                any User Content, and under no circumstances will RoxStar be liable in any way for 
                any User Content, where permissible under applicable laws and regulations. <br>
                (c) Intellectual Property Rights.<b> As a condition of your access to and use of the 
                    Service, you agree not to use your User Content to infringe on any intellectual 
                    property rights. We reserve the rights, with or without notice, at any time and 
                    in our sole discretion, to take down, block access to and/or terminate your User 
                    Content and/or your account which infringes or is alleged to infringe any 
                    copyrights or other intellectual property right. Subject to any third party rights 
                    in any preexisting content included within your User Content, including 
                    RoxStar Content, you retain ownership of any rights you may have in your 
                    User Content and submitting your User Content to the Service does not transfer 
                    ownership of your rights and by submitting User Content to the Service will not 
                    eliminate you as the copyright owner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you 
                    acknowledge and agree that no User Recording will be considered to be a 
                    separate copyrightable work and all rights in each User Recording will belong 
                    to the owners of the content used to create such User Recording.</b><br>
                    (d) Licenses to User Content. By submitting User Content on or through the Service, 
                    you hereby grant RoxStar an unrestricted, assignable, sub-licensable, revocable, 
                    royalty-free license throughout the universe to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, 
                    communicate to the public, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio 
                    transmissions and on a through-to-the-audience basis), make available, create 
                    derivative works from, retransmit from External Sites, and otherwise exploit and use 
                    (collectively, <b>"Use"</b>) all or any part of all User Content you Post to or through the 
                    Service by any means and through any media and formats now known or hereafter 
                    developed, for the purposes of (i) advertising, marketing and promoting RoxStar 
                    and the Service; (ii) displaying and sharing your User Content to other Users of the 
                    Service; and (iii) providing the Service as authorized by this Agreement. You further 
                    grant RoxStar a royalty-free license to use your username, image, voice and likeness 
                    to identify you as the source of any of your User Content. You must not Post any 
                    User Content on or through the Service or transmit to RoxStar, any User Content 
                    that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. Any User Content Posted by you 
                    to or through the Service or transmitted to RoxStar will be considered non
                    confidential and non-proprietary, and treated as such by RoxStar, and may be used 
                    by RoxStar in accordance with this Agreement without notice to you and without 
                    any liability to RoxStar. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the 
                    preceding sentences of this Section include, but are not limited to, the right to 
                    reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical 
                    works embodied in such sound recordings) and publicly perform and communicate 
                    to the public sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a 
                    royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting RoxStar the right to use your 
                    User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but 
                    not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical 
                    work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., 
                    ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a "PRO"), a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange), 
                    any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved 
                    in the creation of User Content.<br> 
                    (e) You Must Have Rights to the Content You Post. You must not Post any User 
                    Content to the Service if you are not the copyright owner of or are not fully 
                    authorized to grant rights in all of the elements of the User Content you intend to 
                    Post to the Service. In addition, if you only own the rights in and to a sound 
                    recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound 
                    recordings, then you must not Post such sound recordings to the Service unless you 
                    have all necessary rights, authorizations and permissions with respect to such 
                    embedded musical works that grant you sufficient rights to grant the licenses to 
                    RoxStar under this Agreement. You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User 
                    Content Posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to 
                    grant the license set forth in this Agreement; (ii) the Posting and Use of your User 
                    Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, 
                    copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any 
                    person, including, but not limited to, the rights of any person visible in any of your 
                    User Content; (iii) the Posting of your User Content on the Service will not require us 
                    to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other 
                    amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and (iv) the Posting of your 
                    User Content on the Service does not result in a breach of contract between you and 
                    a third party. You agree to pay all monies owing to any person as a result of Posting 
                    your User Content on the Service. <br>
                    (f) Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer 
                    or author of a musical work and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your 
                    PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through this Agreement to us. You are 
                    solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO's reporting 
                    obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must 
                    obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set 
                    forth in this Agreement or have such music publisher enter into this Agreement with 
                    us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you 
                    have the right to grant us the licenses in this Agreement. If you are a recording artist 
                    under contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that 
                    your use of the Service is in compliance with any contractual obligations you may 
                    have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the 
                    Service that may be claimed by your label.<br> 
                    (g) Through-To-The-Audience Rights. All of the rights you grant in this Agreement 
                    are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators 
                    of External Sites will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for 
                    User Content Posted or Used on such External Sites via the Service. <br>
                    (h) Waiver of Rights to User Content. By Posting User Content to or through the 
                    Service, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or 
                    promotional materials related to such User Content. You also waive any and all rights 
                    of privacy, publicity or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your 
                    User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not 
                    transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all 
                    moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights 
                    that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the 
                    Service. <br>
                    (i) Objectionable Content. You are not permitted to and agree not to Post any User 
                    Content to the Service that is or could be interpreted to be (i) abusive, bullying, 
                    defamatory, harassing, harmful, hateful, inaccurate, infringing, libelous, objectionable, 
                    obscene, offensive, pornographic, shocking, threatening, unlawful, violent, vulgar, 
                    pedophilic, invasive of another's privacy including bodily privacy, insulting or 
                    harassing on the basis of gender, libelous, racially or ethnically objectionable, relating 
                    or encouraging money laundering or gambling, or otherwise inconsistent with or 
                    contrary to the applicable laws in force; (ii) promoting any product, good or service, 
                    or bigotry, discrimination, hatred, intolerance, racism or inciting violence (including 
                    suicide); (iii) with respect to Library Tracks, harshly critical of any Library Track, the 
                    copyright owner(s) thereof, or any author, contributor or royalty participant of any 
                    Library Track; (iv) belonging to another person over which you do not have any right; 
                    (v) harming minors in any way; (vi) deceiving or misleading the addressee or recipient 
                    of such information about the origin of such information; (vii) threatening the unity, 
                    integrity, defense, security or sovereignty of any country, friendly relations with 
                    foreign states, or public order or causes incitement to the commission of any 
                    cognizable offence or prevents investigation of any offence or is insulting other 
                    nation. (viii) patently false and untrue and having been written or published with the 
                    intent to harass or mislead for financial gain, or causing injury to any person; or is 
                    patently false or misleading, but is knowingly and intentionally communicated as it 
                    can be reasonably perceived as a fact; (ix) infringing any patent, trademark, copyright 
                    or other proprietary rights; and (x) content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of 
                    children including child sexual abuse materials, promotes predatory behavior 
                    towards children, and/or any others that endangers children (“Child Abuse and 
                    Exploitation”), in each of clauses (i - x) of this paragraph, as RoxStar may determine 
                    in its sole and absolute discretion (collectively, <b>"Objectionable Content"</b>). The 
                    Posting of any Objectionable Content may subject you to third party claims and none 
                    of the rights granted to you in this Agreement may be raised as a defense against 
                    any third party claims arising from your Posting of Objectionable Content. You also 
                    agree not to use the Service for illegal or unlawful purposes, including, without 
                    limitation, to stalk any other User or to encourage any User to harm himself or 
                    herself or any other person. If you encounter any Objectionable Content on the 
                    Service, then please immediately email RoxStar via the information in Section 17 
                    <b>“Contact us”</b> or report us through the functionality offered on the Service. You 
                    acknowledge and agree that RoxStar provides you with the ability to report 
                    Objectionable Content as a courtesy, and RoxStar has no obligation to remove or 
                    take any other action with respect to any Objectionable Content on the Service that 
                    you report to us. However, RoxStar in its sole discretion may take any actions it 
                    deems necessary and/or appropriate against any Objectionable Content and any 
                    User who Posts Objectionable Content on the Service, including, but not limited to, 
                    warning the User, suspending or terminating the User's Account, removing  the 
                    Objectionable Content and/or all of the User's User Content Posted on the Service

                    (j) Modifications. RoxStar's Service is interactive. Thus, your User Content may be 
                    modified by other Users of the Service without your prior approval, such as recording 
                    collaboration videos. Such modifications may enhance or detract from your User 
                    Content and you. You acknowledge and agree that other Users of the Service may so 
                    modify your User Content at any time following submission thereof and assume the 
                    risks related thereto. <br>
                    (k) Endorsements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, you 
                    represent and warrant that you will comply with all laws and regulations regarding 
                    endorsements or testimonials made by you in any User Content, including that you 
                    will (i) make only accurate statements that represent your genuine experience with 
                    any product, good or service and (ii) make all required disclosures pursuant to 
                    applicable regulatory guides on the use of endorsements and testimonials in 
                    advertising. <br>
                    (l) No Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, RoxStar will not be liable for any 
                    unauthorized use of User Content by any User.

                        to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Service.<br>
                        (b) Repeat Infringer Policy. RoxStar's intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or

                        intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property

                        User Content uploaded to the Service by <b>“repeat infringers”</b>. RoxStar considers a

                        through the Service and for whom RoxStar has received more than two takedown 
                        notices with respect to such User Content or Feedback. RoxStar has discretion, 
                        however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a single notification of 
                        claimed infringement or upon RoxStar’s own determination. <br>
                        (c) Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any content

                        (e) Designated Agent Contact Information. RoxStar's designated agent for receipt of 
                        Notifications of Claimed Infringement (the <b>"Designated Agent"</b>) can be contacted 
                        via E-mail at <a href="mailto:support@RoxStarstudioz.com">support@RoxStarstudioz.com</a> (for RoxStar Mobile) <br>

                        must be in writing, provided to RoxStar's Designated Agent through one of the 
                        methods identified in Section 9 (e) and include substantially the following 
                        information: <br>
                        (1) A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; <br>
                        (2) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been 
                        disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or 
                        access to it was disabled; <br>
                        (3) A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief 
                        that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification

                        under Section 9 (c) above or an agent of such person. 
                        A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer to confirm the 
                        party's obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the applicable 
                        copyright laws. <br>
                        (g) Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter 
                        Notification to RoxStar in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then

                        access to it in 10 business days, and RoxStar will replace the removed User Content 
                        or Feedback and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, 
                        business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless RoxStar's

                        Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to 
                        restrain the User from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on 
                        RoxStar's system or network. <br>

                        who knowingly materially misrepresents:<br> (1) that material or activity is infringing, or 
                        <br>(2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, 
                        will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the 
                        alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, 
                        or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of 
                        RoxStar relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the 
                        material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or 
                        ceasing to disable access to it. RoxStar reserves the right to seek damages from any 
                        party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in 
                        violation of applicable laws.

                        the calculation of your Coin account balance. RoxStar may make certain features or 
                        functionality of the Service available that allow or require the redemption of Coins,

                        functionality or otherwise change the manner in which Coins may be redeemed. The 
                        cost to purchase Coins is determined by RoxStar in its sole discretion, including any

                            permitted by RoxStar. The amount of Coins needed to obtain Virtual Goods will be 
                            displayed at the point of redemption.<b>RoxStar may determine, in its sole 
                                discretion, what Virtual Goods may be available for redemption through the

                                through the Services, which RoxStar has no obligation to continue to do.</b><br>(c) Limitations. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or 
                                anyone using an Account registered to you in connection with the Coins or Virtual
