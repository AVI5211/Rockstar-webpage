            <p><b>1. What types of Personal Data do we collect and our
                purposes  </b></p>
            <p> The scope of Personal Data we collect depends on the functions of Rockstar you use 
                and how you use these functions. The purposes and types of Personal Data we 
                collect are summarized in the below.</p>
            <p><b>A. The Personal Data you directly provide to us 
                    Registration and Login.</b></p>
            <p>
                If you choose to register for a Rockstar account by email or 
                mobile phone number (if applicable), we may need to collect your basic profile 
                information such as your user nickname, age, avatar, gender, email or mobile phone 
                number. If you refuse to provide such Personal Data, you will not be able to 
                complete the registration process and can only use very limited functions of Rockstar 
                as a visitor. After you have logged in, you may also choose to add additional 
                Personal Data to your personal profile page, such as your birthday, horoscope sign, 
                relationship status, hometown, educational background, occupation, personal tags, 
                etc. to show your personalized image. New users of Rockstar may also log in through 
                a third-party platform account (please refer to Section 1.C below for more 
                information). 
                To further clarify, we collect the age/birthday provided by users for (i) compliance 
                with laws. By requiring users to provide age/birthday information, Rockstar can 
                restrict access to certain features and content that may not be appropriate for minors 
                to comply with laws in different regions, and request consent from the parents to 
                their children’s use of Rockstar and the process of the minor’s Personal Data. (ii) 
                account security and authentication. By verifying a user's age/birthday, Rockstar can 
                better protect users from fraudulent accounts, unauthorized access, and other 
                security issues. (iii) community safety and compliance. Age/birthday information 
                helps identify and address issues related to minors, such as the protection of minors 
                and the prevention of child abuse or delinquent behavior. (iv) ad targeting and 
                personalized experience. Rockstar uses age/birthday information to better 
                understand the characteristics of its users, to provide a more personalized 
                experience, and to ensure that ads are more accurately delivered to the target user. <b>Creating UGC and Sharing.</b> 
                When you post any user-generated content<b>("UGC") </b>such as your musical performance or rhythm-based performance or singing 
                composition or news feed (including any content in forms of audio, video, image, 
                text, etc.) within Rockstar, we may need to collect the UGC you post, the time you 
                post, location data, singing records, song list, etc. depending on the specific function 
                you use. When you turn on the [beauty camera] function, we will process your facial 
                image data in the video or live streaming to help you automatically present a better 
                personal image. After you create and post your UGC, we will generate and process 
                data related to your UGC, such the number of your followers and content views.
                <b>Please note that some of our UGC creating and sharing functions are only 
                    available to non-minor users. In order to protect the safety and privacy of 
                    minors, we will process the user's facial recognition data during the use of 
                    respective functions to ensure that the user is not a minor. Such facial 
                    recognition data may constitute special categories of Personal Data (sensitive 
                    Personal Data). We will not process such data beyond that specific purpose and 
                    we will do our best to ensure the security of your data.</b>   In addition, in order to 
                    recommend songs suitable for you and optimize your user experience, we may 
                    extract facial image data and/or voice data from your UGC (such as video and/or 
                    audio clips) to help Rockstar know your approximate age and gender. Please be 
                    assured that we will delete relevant extracted data as soon as we have identified your 
                    approximate age and gender, and we will not use such data for other purposes. 
                    <b>Identity Authentication. </b> For special categories of users such as celebrities, media 
                    artists, and professional singers, we offer an identify authentication service so that 
                    the authenticated identity tag can be associated to your account and personal pages. 
                    You will need to contact our corporate staff to apply for identity authentication. 
                    Depending on the specific circumstances, we may require your photo, phone number 
                    and other identity data to complete authentication. <b>Contact and Marketing.</b> We may use the contact information provided by you (e.g., 
                    email address) to conduct user survey or to send you information about products 
                    and services that may be of interest to you. Where required by applicable laws and 
                    regulations, we will obtain your consent before sending you marketing messages. If 
                    you are not interested in such information, you may refuse at any time during the 
                    communication, for example, by clicking on the unsubscribe/refuse option or 
                    sending us a reply to opt-out.
                    <b>B. The Personal Data provided by you or generated during your use of Rockstar  
                        Content Viewing.</b> Any user can view publicly available UGC within Rockstar and you 
                        do not need to register a Rockstar account or login to view such UGC, but it is 
                        necessary to login with an account .. Whether you are viewing after login or as a 
                        visitor, we may collect your browsing history so that you can record and further 
                        explore the content you have viewed.  
                    <b>Social Network and Interaction.</b> In order to provide you with a better social 
                    network experience and to increase the number of views of your own UGC, we may 
                    ask you at login if you provide us with the access to your Contacts on your device so 
                    that we can find friends for you within Rockstar community; you may decline to 
                    provide us with this access and it will not affect your use of other functions of 
                    Rockstar. We may also recommend users that you may wish to follow based on data 
                    analysis, and you may decline or turn off our recommendations. If you wish to add 
                    friends manually, you may provide us with the user ID of your friend, your location 
                    data (by turning on the location access on your device), or a list of friends from a 
                    third-party social platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter) so that 
                    we can find or recommend other users for you. If you use the Creating Rooms 
                    function, we may collect the names and tags of the rooms you create. In addition, 
                    Rockstar also offers other social network features such as Partner Space, Friendship 
                    and Family, which enable you to interact with other users and enjoy Rockstar in your 
                    way. <b>Chat and Message. </b>When you use the IM Chat function, we may collect your text 
                    chat data and/or voice chat data, depending on the specific method you use. Please 
                    do not worry, your chat data is protected by encryption and we process your chat 
                    data only for security purpose, such as automatic screening illegal information about 
                    pornography, violence, or scams. 
                    <b>Payment and Transaction. </b> When you use our top up or payment functions 
                    (including Noble Identity, VIP, etc.) and initiate a payment request, we need to collect 
                    your user ID, country/region, payment currency, payment amount, payment time, 
                    payment method, order number and other information to complete the payment and 
                    transaction process via the Application Program Interface (API) supported by the 
                    third-party payment service providers. In order to prevent money laundering and 
                    related illegal activities, we may require you to provide a government-issued ID to 
                    verify your identity to comply with relevant legal obligations when you withdraw 
                    coins or virtual properties from Rockstar. 
                    <b>Feedback and Report.</b>When you use the feedback function within Rockstar, we 
                    need to collect the feedback description and screenshot. If you do not provide such 
                    information, we may not be able to help you resolve the issue or respond to your 
                    feedback. In addition, if you wish to make a report (for example, when you discover 
                    any illegal content, illegal user activity, or your rights have been violated), we need to 
                    collect a description of your report, the type of report, and relevant chat logs (if any) 
                    in order to understand the facts and help you resolve the issue.
                    <b>Improving User Experience.</b>To improve your user experience (e.g., by making it 
                    easier for you to view information about your account, sending you push 
                    notifications, and providing you with personalized content and services that may be 
                    of interest to you), we may automatically collect information about your language, 
                    gender, clicks and actions, program progress (including login status, interaction

                    Rockstar and your account, we will automatically collect data related to the operation 
                    of the mobile application and your online operations, such as data related to your 
                    login status, clicks and actions, user device data (e.g., IMEI and other device 
                    identifiers), operating system data, network information (e.g., IP address), etc. when

                        or other platforms and learn more about their data processing practices. For 
                        example, we use the YouTube API Services to enable you to get the data, content 
                        (including audiovisual content) and information, and other services provided by 
                        Youtube <b>("Youtube API Services")</b>. Before accessing Youtube API Services, you are

                        (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) and the Google Privacy Policy 
                        (http://www.google.com/policies/privacy), subject to which Youtube may collect and 
                        process your Personal Data when you are using Youtube API Services. 
                        Please note that if your profile is public, your content will be visible to anyone on the

                        <h3>5. How do we protect your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p><h4>To provide you with a privacy-friendly environment, Rockstar offers a variety of 
                        privacy protection features to limit the Personal Data that other users can see, 
                        such as: you can set your account to private status and hide your UGC content; 
                        you can conceal your friendship space to others; and if you are a VIP user, you 
                        can delete the view history after accessing other users’ content or space, and 
                        you can hide your followers and information about the people you follow from 
                        strangers. In addition, you can also set the types of notifications (e.g., content 
                        updates, online alerts, interactive messages, popular recommendations, etc.) 
                        you want to receive or reject within Rockstar. We also provide a nighttime 
                        mode to reduce disturbance to you. 
                        We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your 
                        Personal Data that we collect and process. The measures that we use are 
                        designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing 
                        your Personal Data.</h4>For example, we adopt encryption at rest to secure all user data 
                        (including database files and backups) and use security keys for data management. 
                        We adopt encryption in transit through TLS 1.2 protocols to protect data flow in the 
                        public network environment from user devices to servers and from servers to servers. 
                        We will also ensure the effective implementation of these technical measures 
                        through code review mechanisms. In addition, we periodically test the applications 
                        and systems for vulnerabilities and security issues, and take access control measures 
                        such as access tokens and multi-factor authentication to ensure information security.</p>
                        <h4>Please be aware and understand that we cannot ensure an absolutely secure 
                            Internet. If you find that your Personal Data is breached, please contact us 
                            using the contact details provided in "How to contact us" immediately so that 
                            we can take the corresponding measures. 
                            In the event of any accident, force majeure event or other circumstances 
                            leading to the breach of your Personal Data, we will make every effort to 
                            control the situation and promptly inform you of the cause, the security 
                            measures we have taken and you can take and other relevant information. In 
                            the event of a security incident related to Personal Data, we will report such 
                            incident to the competent authorities in accordance with the requirements of 
                            applicable laws and regulations, promptly investigate the problem, and take 
                            the emergency measures.</h4>

                        global operation and security management, your Personal Data may be transferred 
                        to and processed in other jurisdictions where our affiliated entities are based in, 
                        which may be different from the jurisdiction you locate. Such jurisdictions may not 
                        provide the same level of data protection as your jurisdiction. Under such 
                        circumstances, we will take necessary and appropriate safeguards to ensure the 
                        security of your Personal Data in transit and require that the recipient of your 
                        Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection and security in accordance with 
                        this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations.

                        needs of our company (e.g., for the purposes of providing service to you and 
                        complying with the requirements of laws, tax and finance), except as provided 
                        otherwise by applicable laws or regulations. When there is no such need to use your
