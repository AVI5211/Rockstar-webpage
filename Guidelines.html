        <h2>Formal Request Channel</h2>
        <p>We accept requests, legal process services, and general questions from law enforcement agencies via email at appsupport@RoxStarinteractive.com.</p>
        <p>Any confirmation of receipt of correspondence is solely for convenience. In doing so, RoxStar does not waive any objection right (including objections based on lack of jurisdiction, invalid legal process or improper service).</p>
        
        <h2>General Information for Law Enforcement</h2>

Details pertaining to the requesting law enforcement authorities should be included in the enforcement request:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Please note that RoxStar can provide the information in so far as RoxStar still possesses the requested information pursuant to its data retention policies. All data is retained for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
            our privacy policy.</p>
            
            <h2>User Notice and Consent</h2>
            
            <p>Our guidelines stipulate that users will be to notified of requests for their information prior to disclosure except in cases where (i) such notification is prohibited by the valid legal procedures, court orders, or applicable laws, (ii) the
            notification could create a risk of injury or death to an identifiable individual(s), or (iii) the cases that involve potential harm to minors. It falls under the responsibility of the requesting law enforcement authority to clearly indicate in their
            request whether any of these criteria are met. RoxStar will comply with such requests where appropriate supporting information is provided, for example, if a non-disclosure obligation under applicable law is referenced.</p>
            
            <p>If a law enforcement official requests information about a user who has given consent for the official to access their account information, the user should be instructed to retrieve that information themselves from their account.</p>
            
            <h2>Preservation Requests</h2>
            
            <p>We respect formal requests from law enforcement to preserve information in accordance with applicable law and regulations. We will maintain any such records in an offline file for up to 90 days. Please note, we may not accommodate
            extension requests.</p>
            
            <p>Preservation requests must be sent on law enforcement letterhead, signed, and must clearly identify the specific user data to be preserved. Please refer to User ID, the data type and date ranges as General Information for Law
            Enforcement above.</p>
            
            <p>If RoxStar does not receive formal legal process for the preserved information before the end of the preservation period, the preserved information may be deleted when the preservation period expires.</p>
            
            <h2>Emergency Requests</h2>
            
            <p>We evaluate and process emergence request on a case-by-case basis. In alignment with applicable laws and regulations, we can voluntarily disclose necessary RoxStar user data when presented with information that is sufficient in
            our assessment to establish an imminent threat such as death, serious physical harm, assault to a minor, risks to the state security, or the threat to critical infrastructures.</p>
            
            <p>Emergency Disclosure Requests must be submitted to RoxStar by a sworn law enforcement official coming from an official law enforcement (or governmental) email domain. Individuals who are not law enforcement personnel but are
            aware of an emergency situation should promptly contact their local law enforcement officials directly.</p>
            
            <h2>Supported languages</h2>
            <p>To help us accurately understand your request, all requests to RoxStar and any supporting documents (including orders, warrants, subpoenas or their equivalents) must be provided in English or accompanied by an English translation.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<p>If a law enforcement request originates from outside Singapore, RoxStar may request the law enforcement authority to submit a request for legal assistance under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty ("MLAT") framework, or by letters rogatory to designated government authorities.</p>

<p>In submitting a request, law enforcement officials are required to ensure that any information provided is complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge and good faith belief, and that the disclosure (or other action) requested is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating crimes, or for preventing an emergency. Once received by law enforcement, the law enforcement authorities are required to handle such data in accordance with applicable laws, including relevant data protection laws.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Guidelines is meant to create any enforceable rights against RoxStar.</p>
<p>RoxStar’s Guidelines may be updated or modified in the future without prior notice to the relevant government or law enforcement authorities.
